Okay, this is nothing that you asked for really - but I did try. The auth for Spotify is what is really slowing me down. I did the tutorial on the devs page, and that went well but transferring it to this it just didn't work. Perhaps someone can point me in the right direction.

Basically this is a one page - very ugly page sorry - just allowing a search and bringing back of tracks of the artist. I managed to get the audio working, which is cool, but again struggled to get images to come down. I've clearly not set up the spotify api right. I didn't style it up as much as I wanted to because I want to get it all working first. 

Plans are though to have the albums or audio files pop up and you can swipe through them using animations. 
I'd also break out styling - but was a bit pointless right now as it's literally a page. But see that Vue has a speciall scss plugin so that's handy. Will probably try and get that working in the next few days when I get a bit more time. 

Speed wise - minification is a must. Not too sure if there's a way to speed it up when making calls to the api. Again, thoughts would be great!

Any pointers would be great as I would like to get this working properly, I just didn't want to have you all wait days and days.. 

All in all though I find vue a little easier to use than Angular. I did the tour of heroes a few months back and remember being a bit confused in places. Perhaps that helped with this. Who knows!

Thanks again, and I look forward to hearing back from you.
